## Reflection Benchmarks
Reflection is a very powerful tool for determining objects during run-time, but it takes performance. There is a widely held opinion throughout the community that reflection is bad and should not be used, yes it is slow, but is it realy problem? Except high performance applications we should always decide for solution which is simple, clean and easy to test and in some specific cases reflection is the solution. Also reflection give us power to write our piece of code generic, so we can reuse it.

# Clean Architecture
## Pros
- **UI/Framework/Database Independence** 
	- Business logic resides at the core, making the architecture adaptable to changes in frameworks, databases, or other external layers with minimal disruption. This ensures future-proofing and flexibility in adopting new technologies.
- **Highly Testable** 
	- Clean Architecture facilitates testing by allowing business logic to be verified in isolation, without relying on external components like databases or external APIs. Its focus on abstractions and dependency inversion simplifies mocking and promotes thorough test coverage.
	- easy to mock because of abstractions
- **Maintainability and Extensibility**
	- The structured design, combined with SOLID principles, ensures that changes remain isolated and predictable. This not only improves maintainability but also makes it easier for teams to collaborate on large codebases and extend functionality with minimal risk of regressions.
- **Technology-Agnostic Core**
	- The core domain is independent of frameworks, making it reusable across different platforms.
- **Clear Boundaries**
  - Establishes well-defined boundaries between components, which helps teams divide work effectively.
## Cons
- **Understanding and Complexity**
	- Understanding the architecture can be challenging, especially for developers or teams unfamiliar with it. Deciding how to split responsibilities or assign code to the correct layer often requires experience and careful consideration.
- **Heavy Structure**
	- The layered structure introduces significant boilerplate code, which can feel excessive for small or simple applications, such as basic CRUD APIs.
- **Performance**
  - The additional layers of abstraction in Clean Architecture can introduce slight performance overhead due to increased indirection and mapping between layers. While this is rarely an issue for most business applications, performance-critical systems may require careful optimization or selective bypassing of certain layers to meet strict performance requirements.
- **Initial Setup Time**
  - Requires more upfront work to establish the structure and abstractions, which may slow down the initial phases of development.
- **Steeper Learning Curve**
  - The strict separation of concerns and abstractions can make onboarding new developers more difficult.

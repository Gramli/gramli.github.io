# ASP.NET Minimal API

## Pros
- **Minimal Hosting Model**
	- Enables the creation of a single, clean entry point for the API.
- **Development Speed**
  - No need for controllers or boilerplate code (though you can still organize mapped methods into files). A single method with fluent API extensions is sufficient.
- **Simplicity** 
  - Reduces the complexity of creating APIs.
- **Performance**
  - With fewer layers of abstraction, it performs better compared to controller-based approaches.
- **Flexibility**
  -  Easily extend functionality for specific endpoints or endpoint groups by adding new extension methods.
-  **Lightweight by Design** 
   - Minimal APIs have a smaller memory footprint, making them ideal for serverless environments or resource-constrained systems.
- **Built-in Support for OpenAPI/Swagger**
    - Minimal APIs include built-in support for generating OpenAPI/Swagger documentation without requiring additional configuration or significant effort.

## Cons
- **Maintenance and Readability**
  - As the project grows, maintaining endpoints can become challenging.
- **Missing Funcionality**
  - Compared to the classic controller-based approach, some features may be lacking. However, maintainers often introduce updates for Minimal APIs with every new release.
- **Learning Curve for Beginners**
  - Developers coming from the traditional controller-based mindset might find the concept of organizing endpoints in Minimal APIs less intuitive initially.

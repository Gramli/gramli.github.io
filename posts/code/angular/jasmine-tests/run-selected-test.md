# Karma Test Commands
This post summarizes commonly used commands for running Angular unit tests with Karma during local development and CI.

## Run selected test

```bash
npm t -- --include src\app\shared\user\user.service.spec.ts
```

* npm t is an alias for npm test
* -- forwards arguments to the underlying test runner (Karma)
* --include limits execution to the specified spec file

## Run all tests
For projects generated by angular CLI.
```bash
ng test
```

This starts Karma in watch mode by default.

### Watch mode

Explicit watch mode (useful when scripting):

```bash
ng test --watch
```

### Run tests in headless mode (CI)
Recommended for CI pipelines:
```bash
ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless
```

### Code coverage
```bash
ng test --code-coverage
```
